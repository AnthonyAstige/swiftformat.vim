# SwiftFormat v0.0.0

## TODO

A lot of stuff, this should probably be a part of NeoFormat

However SwiftFormat is returning an exit code of 0 when it's failing, causing the output to be put in current buffer

* Maybe just getting them to return a good exit code could make neovim work with it? Wrap it to test?

If keep this around

* Make params configurable (instead of my tabs only setting)
